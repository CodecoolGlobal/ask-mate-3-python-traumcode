5,1610047876,13,25,Input button active styling? (without anchors),"However, styling the ""pressed down"" state is proving difficult. everywhere i look online, designers seem to bypass this problem by using anchors, and then taking advantage of css's :active pseudo-class. unfortunately, it appears buttons do not have this. they have :focus, but that doesn't really work the same way.

so my question is this: is it possible to style a ""down"" state without modifying this html? i am willing to use jquery if necessary, but i'm mostly hoping that there is a pure css solution that doesn't involve anchors. what do you all recommend?

thanks!",
